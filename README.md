# react-preLoader
very simple react preLoader !! simpleeeeeeee

ok so,
there is not much thing to say,
in preview.js i just used window.onLoad event to set a state true or false.
try to make your costum Preloader.js file locally and you must do it actually.
i've provided loader js & scss(you can easily compile it with sass) and preview and there is simple index.js to render all these
if you had any problem just open a pull request
